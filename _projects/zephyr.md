The concept of Zephyr were born from the original team of Kuna. It was supposed to be a continuation of the original projects of Synergy88 but it was never realized after a shift of focus in the management. After years on the shelf,
it was again brought up and became one of the showcase project of Synergy88. Sasdly, it still remained unfinished.
