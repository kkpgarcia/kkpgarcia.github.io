This engine was my final project in an Introduction to Computer Science II. The idea of the project is to create a simple game using Java Graphics API and a server that would enable multiplayer.

Being a professional in an introductory class, I was eager to get more out of learning out of it.  It is the reason why I decided to work on an engine and a real-time multiplayer server.
