### Technology

|:---------|:----------|
| Engine    |        Unreal |
| Language      |         C++/Blueprint | 
| Backend      |         GameSparks | 
|       |         JavaScript | 


Originally, Tofu Heroes was made in Singapore and it has already been in develop for 5 years. Prior to joining MOS, Tofu Heroes was already in the hands of the Philippine development team.
I was originally hired as a Backend Developer, however, there were no documentation of the project to be found, and the team was having a hard time to bring in new features for the game.

### The New Tofu Heroes

There was a clear problem with the production as a simple match-3 game shouldn't take long. I initiated a revamp of the whole game, and transformed it to what it is today. It took the whole team of 5
to do it in less than 6 months of development time to re-do the project with better architecture, solutions, and direction.

### Saving Time and Cost

At the time that I joined MOS, the company has already been shelling out 5000 USD per month for almost three years of unmanned AWS services. The first thing that I did was to investigate how these services
are being used, and to see alternatives for it.

It was indeed the server cost for a full release of Tofu Heroes worldwide. Given that the release didn't came into fruition, the original team was not able to close everything down. I decided to close everything
and use GameSparks to solve half of all our production problems.
