Builder 1.0 is the 2nd iteration of Cloudberrie Builder where UX team are now involved in the development process. It is an extension of the prototype version of Builder. A UI overhaul was made and a lot of features were added since the prototype version. There are some systems that was made from scratch as well:

- Interaction System
- Behaviour System
- Instruction System

I was only involved in the instruction system since it usuable, but not that extensible. Here I adapted a no-code approach where a user could create instructions using nodes, and conditions which are pre-requisite to move to next connected nodes.

It was improved by the UX team to be user friendly and simple.
