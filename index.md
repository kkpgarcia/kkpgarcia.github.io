A Game Developer who is knowledgeable in different areas of game development.

My expertise is authoring games, building architecture for it, and research and development that is in line with the future of technology.
I develop games in Unity, Unreal, and WebGL. I create my engines out of boredom to hone my skills and find ways to improve game development in terms of speed, architecture and find new patterns that work better than what I have written before.

Outside game development, my following most vital skills are server development and web. I can converse properly with server developers and fully collaborate with them with my current server and web development expertise.
Mobile Development would be my least strong compared to other types of development.
