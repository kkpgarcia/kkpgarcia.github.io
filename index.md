A Game Developer who is knowledgeable in different areas of game development. 
My expertise is authoring games, building architecture for it, and research and development that is in line with the future of technology.

I develop games in Unity, Unreal, and WebGL. I create my engines out of boredom to hone my skills and find ways to improve game development in terms of speed, architecture and find new patterns that work better than what I have written before.

Outside game development, my following strongest skills are server development and web. Not entirely by experience, though, I will be able to create something based on frameworks or scratch. With my current server and web development expertise, I can converse properly with server developers and fully collaborate with them.

Mobile Development would be my least strong compared to other types of development. Shockingly though, I have a good amount of expertise in art. Conversing with artists is second to my nature, and with my art expertise, I can understand the requirements for them and help them build better assets that are well suited for games. The professional barrier wouldn't be an issue.
