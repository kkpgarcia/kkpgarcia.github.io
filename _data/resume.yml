      Initially, I was hired as a Backend Developer. I proposed leading the Philippines game development team instead of improving its pipeline and delivering quicker with an initiative in mind.

      Being the lead, I was part of the decision process in the studio. I have handled different professionals from Artists, Developers, and Business Marketing.

      One initiative has also helped the studio save USD 5000/month in redundant services and streamline the production processes.

      - "Saved USD 5000/month in bills"
      - "Lead a development studio to success"
