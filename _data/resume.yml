      Initially, I was hired as a Backend Developer. With an initiative in mind, I proposed leading the Philippines game development team instead of improving its pipeline and delivering quicker.

      Being the lead, I was part of the decision process in the studio. I have handled different professionals from Artists, Developers, and Business Marketing.

      One initiative has also helped the studio save USD 5000/month in redundant services and streamlining the production processes.
    highlights:
      - "Saved USD 5000/month in bills"
      - "Lead a development studio to success"
      - "Released a game earlier than the proposed timeline"
